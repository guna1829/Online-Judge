- Go to https://aistudio.google.com/
- Create an API key
- Copy the key

### 2. Configure Backend
Add to `backend/.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyYourActualAPIKeyHere
```

### 3. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend && npm run dev
```

## 📊 Mock vs Real Reviews

### Mock Reviews (No API Key)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Basic code analysis
- ✅ Problem context included
- ✅ Setup instructions
- ⚠️ Limited analysis depth

### Real Reviews (With API Key)
- ✅ Comprehensive analysis
- ✅ Detailed complexity analysis
- ✅ Problem-specific insights
- ✅ Competitive programming tips
- ✅ Advanced optimizations

## 🎯 Example Output

### Mock Review
```
## 🤖 Mock AI Review (CPP)

## 📋 Problem Context
**Title**: Two Sum
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Description**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target...

## 🔍 Solution Analysis
Your code appears to be 245 characters long. ✅ Good: Contains main function.

## 📊 Algorithm Assessment
✅ Contains loops - Good for iterative solutions
✅ Contains conditionals - Good for decision making

## ⚡ Performance & Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: O(?) - Mock analysis (real AI would provide detailed analysis)
- **Space Complexity**: O(?) - Mock analysis (real AI would provide detailed analysis)
```

### Real Review (With API Key)
```
## 🤖 AI Code Review (CPP)

## 📋 Problem Context
**Title**: Two Sum
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Description**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target...

## 1. SOLUTION CORRECTNESS ✅
Your solution correctly implements the Two Sum problem using a hash map approach.
- ✅ Handles all edge cases properly
- ✅ Meets problem constraints (1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^4)
- ✅ Will pass all test cases

## 2. ALGORITHM ANALYSIS
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Excellent! Single pass through the array
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Optimal for hash map approach
- **Optimality**: This is the optimal solution for this problem
- **Alternative**: Brute force would be O(n²), your approach is much better

## 3. CODE QUALITY
- ✅ Clear variable naming (nums, target, seen)
- ✅ Good code structure
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ⚠️ Consider adding comments for clarity

## 4. COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING TIPS
- 🏆 Excellent hash map usage - very common in CP
- 🎯 This pattern works for many similar problems
